        "Is Brutus sick? And is it physical\nTo walk unbracèd and suck up the humors\nOf the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\nAnd will he steal out of his wholesome bed\nTo dare the vile contagion of the nigh\nAnd tempt the rheumy and unpurgèd air\nTo add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,\nYou have some sick offense within your mind,\nWhich by the right and virtue of my place\nI ought to know of. She kneels. And upon my\nknees\nI charm you, by my once commended beauty,\nBy all your vows of love, and that great vow\nWhich did incorporate and make us one,\nThat you unfold to me, your self, your half,\nWhy you are heavy, and what men tonight\nHave had resort to you; for here have been\nSome six or seven who did hide their faces\nEven from darkness."

        "Could great men thunder,\nAs Jove himself does, Jove would never be quiet,\nFor every pelting, petty officer\nWould use his heaven for thunder,\nNothing but thunder. Merciful heaven,\nThou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt\nSplits the unwedgeable and gnarlèd oak,\nThan the soft myrtle. But man, proud man,\nDressed in a little brief authority,\nMost ignorant of what he/’s most assured,\nHis glassy essence, like an angry ape\nPlays such fantastic tricks before high heaven\nAs makes the angels weep, who with our spleens\nWould all themselves laugh mortal."

        "Hard to seem won; but I was won, my lord,\nWith the first glance that ever—pardon me;\nIf I confess much, you will play the tyrant.\nI love you now, but till now not so much\nBut I might master it. In faith, I lie;\nMy thoughts were like unbridled children grown\nToo headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!\nWhy have I blabbed? Who shall be true to us\nWhen we are so unsecret to ourselves?\nBut though I loved you well, I wooed you not;\nAnd yet, good faith, I wished myself a man;\nOr that we women had men’s privilege\nOf speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,\nFor in this rapture I shall surely speak\nThe thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,\nCunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws\nMy very soul of counsel! Stop my mouth."

        "First, let me tell you whom you have condemned: Not one begotten of a shepherd swain, But issued from the progeny of kings, Virtuous and holy, chosen from above By inspiration of celestial grace To work exceeding miracles on earth. I never had to do with wicked spirits. But you, that are polluted with your lusts, Stained with the guiltless blood of innocents, Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices, Because you want the grace that others have, You judge it straight a thing impossible To compass wonders but by help of devils. No, misconceivèd! Joan of Arc hath been A virgin from her tender infancy, Chaste and immaculate in very thought, Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused, Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven."
